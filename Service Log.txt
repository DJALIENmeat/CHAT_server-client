Python 3.*.* IRC Chat

IRC Chat Server/Client

Needs Fixing;
	*	Users connecting detected as "self set variable name" instead of "Thread-2, Thread-3 ect."
	*	Crash/Hang after first message sent.
	*	Refresh all messages immediately clientside.
	
	
Not needed at moment but want implemented eventually;
	*	Full daily log if server restarted though day just adds on to end of days log.
		+ Create new log daily
	*	Username/Password Database to only allow user from database to use service.
	*	Home page to show #Rules to user and user must accept ToS to proceed to chat.
	*	Dictionary definition to ban all explicate word including abbreviations
	*	Function //REPORT! makes REPORT.txt in server main folder with logged time/date.
